CrailsCMS is a C++ Content Management System built using the [Crails Framework](https://crails-framework.github.io/website/).
It is designed to let developers easily implement flexible component-based theme that users and integrators can then
easily leverage to create their own custom website.

CrailsCMS provides two way of designing your page:

- _Document_ pages implementing [CKEditor5](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/) to provide you with a content
  managing experience similar to Wordpress's page editor.

- _Layout_ pages using our own custom page editor, built on [ContentTools](https://getcontenttools.com),
  which builds pages by putting customizable components (text, image, sliders) together in a grid based
  and **responsive** layout.

Using the Crails Framework also makes it easy for developers to switch from simple Content Management to full on
web development, all while taking advantages of the performance, lightness and reliability of a C++ code base.
